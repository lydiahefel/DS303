## Coding Categorical Predictors

Working with categorical predictors is an important aspect of building effective statistical models. Categorical predictors, also known as factors, represent qualitative data that can be organized into distinct groups, such as gender, geographic location, or product type.

In R, these predictors can be integrated into various modeling techniques, helping us identify relationships and make predictions based on different *levels* of these variables.

## UCLA Reference

There are many resources out there, but this is one I go back to again and again. I find it really easy to understand and to also use as a reference:

[**R LIBRARY CONTRAST CODING SYSTEMS FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES**](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/)

## Set up your environment

### Load packages

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load Data

Following the UCLA resource, we will use data frame called `hsb2` and focusing on the categorical variable `race`, which has four levels (1 = Hispanic, 2 = Asian, 3 = African American and 4 = Caucasian). We will use `write` as our dependent variable.

[Here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=hsb2) is a brief description of `hsb2` data (but note that they have filled in some of their values a bit differently than we have below).

```{r}
# read in data from URL
hsb2 <- read.table('https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsb2.csv', header=T, sep=",")

skim <- skimr::skim(hsb2)

summary(as.factor(hsb2$race))
```

Let's create `race.f`, which is the `race` data re-labeled and also turned into factors.

```{r}
hsb2$race.f <- factor(hsb2$race, labels=c("Hispanic", "Asian", "African-Am", "Caucasian"))
```

### Inspect your data

Inspect your data below using `skimr`, `summary`, and `ggplot2`. You should also check out [this resource](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=hsb2), which describes the dataset.

```{r}
skim <- skimr::skim(hsb2)
View(skim)

summary(hsb2)
summary(hsb2$race)
summary(hsb2$race.f)

ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = race.f, y = write)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = race.f, y = write)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0) 

```

## Coding Schemes

There are several different coding schemes, and you can also generate your own scheme for your own purposes. For our class, we will focus on **Dummy**, **Simple**, **Deviation**, and **Helmert** Coding.

We've already seen dummy coding, but it is good to see it again.

## Class activity

Split into four groups. Explore your assigned coding scheme and answer the below five questions. Then, apply your coding scheme to the `hsb2` data and walk us through its interpretation.

## Dummy Coding (a.k.a. Treatment Coding)

(Vlad)

1.  What comparisons are made with this coding scheme? How does this coding scheme affect the coefficients in regression models? (What do the coefficients represnt? What is the reference level?)\
    \

2.  When is this coding scheme preferred? What types of data or analysis scenarios make this coding method particularly useful?\
    \

3.  What are the advantages of this coding method? How does it simplify interpretation or enhance model performance?\
    \

4.  What are the limitations of this coding method? Are there situations where this method may lead to misleading results or interpretations?\
    \
    \

### Applying Dummy Coding

```{r}
# assign dummy coding
contrasts(hsb2$race.f)

# build and summarize your regression
dummy <- lm(write ~ race.f, data = hsb2)
summary(dummy)
```

Summarize these findings. What is your reference group, and how do the other groups compare with regards to their writing scores? What does the intercept value represent?\
\
(write here)\

## Simple Coding

(Lydia)

1.  What comparisons are made with this coding scheme? How does this coding scheme affect the coefficients in regression models? (What do the coefficients represent? What is the reference level?)

    Simple coding compares each level to the reference level. The only difference is coefficients lies in the intercept, which is the grand mean. Aside from the intercept, there is no change in what the coefficients represent compared to dummy coding. The reference level is whichever level comes first, either alphabetically or numerically.

2.  When is this coding scheme preferred? What types of data or analysis scenarios make this coding method particularly useful?

    Simple coding is preferred when being able to compare categorical means to the overall grand mean, rather than only the reference level. Simple coding is particularly useful when working with unbalanced data.

3.  What are the advantages of this coding method? How does it simplify interpretation or enhance model performance?

    The advantage of simple coding is that each categorical mean can be compared to the overall mean rather than only the reference level. Since simple coding is useful for unbalanced data, it enhances the model by reducing overfitting.

4.  What are the limitations of this coding method? Are there situations where this method may lead to misleading results or interpretations?

    A limitation of simple coding is that the reference level is a variable that may not always be an actual baseline, only because it came first alphabetically or numerically. The contrast matrix is a bit more confusing than dummy coding (i.e. -1/k and (k-1)/k).

### Applying Simple Coding

```{r}
# assign simple coding
#creating the contrast matrix manually by modifying the dummy coding scheme
c <- contr.treatment(4)
my.coding <- matrix(rep(1/4, 12), ncol=3)
my.simple <- c-my.coding
my.simple


contrasts(hsb2$race.f) <- my.simple
summary(lm(write ~ race.f, hsb2))


# build and summarize your regression
simple <- lm(write ~ race.f, data = hsb2)
summary(simple)

?contr.treatment
```

Summarize these findings. What is your reference group, and how do the other groups compare with regards to their writing scores? What does the intercept value represent?\
\
(write here)\

## Deviation Coding (a.k.a. Effect Coding)

(Grace)

1.  What comparisons are made with this coding scheme? How does this coding scheme affect the coefficients in regression models? (What do the coefficients represnt? What is the reference level?)\

2.  When is this coding scheme preferred? What types of data or analysis scenarios make this coding method particularly useful?\

3.  What are the advantages of this coding method? How does it simplify interpretation or enhance model performance?\

4.  What are the limitations of this coding method? Are there situations where this method may lead to misleading results or interpretations?

### Applying Deviation Coding

```{r}
# assign deviation coding
contr.sum(4)


#assigning the deviation contrasts to race.f
contrasts(hsb2$race.f) = contr.sum(4)
#the regression
summary(lm(write ~ race.f, hsb2))

hsb2$race.f <- relevel(hsb2$race.f, ref = "Asian")


# build and summarize your regression
dev <- lm(write ~ race.f, data = hsb2)
summary(dev)

# Get the mean of the fourth group (e.g., "Caucasian")
mean_caucasian <- mean(subset(hsb2, race.f == "Caucasian")$write)

# Compare it to the grand mean (intercept value)
grand_mean <- coef(lm(write ~ race.f, data = hsb2))["(Intercept)"]


means_tapply <- tapply(hsb2$write, hsb2$race.f, mean)
print(means_tapply)

m_o_m <- (46.45833+58+48.2+54.05517)/4
g_m <- mean(hsb2$write)

summary(hsb2$race.f)
```

Summarize these findings. Unlike dummy and simple coding, there is no traditional reference level in deviation coding. In this context, how do the groups compare regarding their writing scores? What does the intercept value represent?\
\
(write here)\

## Helmert Coding

(Beryl)

1.  What comparisons are made with this coding scheme? How does this coding scheme affect the coefficients in regression models? (What do the coefficients represnt? What is the reference level?)\
    \

2.  When is this coding scheme preferred? What types of data or analysis scenarios make this coding method particularly useful?\
    \

3.  What are the advantages of this coding method? How does it simplify interpretation or enhance model performance?\
    \

4.  What are the limitations of this coding method? Are there situations where this method may lead to misleading results or interpretations?\
    \
    \
    \

### Applying Helmert Coding

```{r}
# assign Helmert coding
#helmert for factor variable with 4 levels
my.helmert = matrix(c(3/4, -1/4, -1/4, -1/4, 0, 2/3, -1/3, -1/3, 0, 0, 1/
	2, -1/2), ncol = 3)
my.helmert
      

#assigning the new helmert coding to race.f
contrasts(hsb2$race.f) = my.helmert
contrasts(hsb2$race.f)

hsb2$race.f <- relevel(hsb2$race.f, ref = "Caucasian")
contrasts(hsb2$race.f) = my.helmert

# build and summarize your regression
helmert <- lm(write ~ race.f, data = hsb2)
summary(helmert)
```

Summarize these findings. In Helmert coding, each level is compared to the mean of subsequent levels, rather than having a traditional reference group. In this context, how do the groups compare regarding their writing scores? What does the intercept value represent?\
\
Answer: Each group's writing score is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels, instead of using a traditional reference group. The intercept value represents the average writing score across all levels before any comparisons are made. The coefficients show how each group’s writing score differs from the average of the following groups.

## For next class: Releveling a predictor

We will do this together as a class. You don't need to work ahead, but if you wanted to explore releveling, here you go.

Releveling refers to the process of changing the reference level of a factor or categorical variable. This allows us to examine how different groups compare to a new reference category. By selecting a different reference level, we can gain new insights into the effects of categorical predictors in our analyses.

Releveling is applicable to Dummy, Simple, and Helmert coding, but NOT deviation coding. Why?

### To relevel:

You can use the below to define a reference level, or you can assign new values in your contrasts matrix.

```{r}
hsb2$race.f <- relevel(hsb2$race.f, ref = "Asian")
```
